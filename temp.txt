Specificity is the soul of narrative - John Hodgman -It is hard to let old beliefs go. They are familiar. We are comfortable with them and have spent years building systems and developing habits that depend on them.Like a man who has worn eyeglasses so long that he forgets he has them on, we forget that the world looks to us the way it does because we have become used to seeing it that way through a particular set of lenses.Today, however, we need new lenses. And we need to throw the old ones away - Kenich Ohmae -True love is the ability to make one woman happy all of her life -  Ricardo Monteban -Temporary solutions aren’t - The Changelog, Host -According to Niebuhr, Christian liberals believe that “a God without wrath brought men without sin into a kingdom without judgement through the ministrations of a Christ without a cross” - Reinhold Niebuhr -It always hurts to ask - John Hodgman -Most of all, perhaps, we need intimate knowledge of the past. Not that the past has any magic about it, but because we cannot study the future, and yet need something to set against the present, to remind us that the basic assumptions have been quite different in different periods and that much which seems certain to the uneducated is merely temporary fashionA man who has lived in many places is not likely to be deceived by the local errors of his native village; the scholar has lived in many times and is therefore in some degree immune from the great cataract of nonsense that pours from the press and the microphone of his own age - CS Lewis -[the] Truth is, I'll never know all there is to know about you just as you will never know all there is to know about me. Humans are by nature too complicated to be understood fully. So, we can choose either to approach our fellow human beings with suspicion or to approach them with an open mind, a dash of optimism and a great deal of candour -  Tom Hanks -TURING: Strictly speaking there are no contradictions in mathematics. It is rather that mathematics is incomplete. There are facts among the numbers that we can never decide are true or falseWITTGENSTEIN: And so what? What could be the significance?TURING: This means that not every well-posed problem has a solution. We can’t know everything - Jana Levin -[she is observing a girl in the park] I keep walking and recede from the girls’ easy confidence in the world’s mechanisms. I believe they exist, even if my knowledge of them can only be imperfect, a crude sketch of the their billions of vibrating atoms. I believe this to be true. The girls are not a product of my imagination and I am not a product of yours. There are just some things that we can’t strictly prove. So let’s take it to be true, this is me - Jana Levin -He searched for the inky pen and wrote each pair of numbers on the table between the  obstacles of saucers and cups as Olga read the tension and the stretching backs and elastic quiet. He outlined for her his numbering system.   “I encode the sentence, this statement is unprovable, into numbers--no words, just numbers.”     “You translate the sentence into a numerical code?”     “Yes, a code of pure numbers.”Playing the part of a good big sister, Olga pitched forward in her seat, her eyes looking up as the waiting to receive a salve.  She tried to catch up to Kurt's argument, keeping pace better than the others, still not quite there. “And then you prove the relation is true?”    “No, I prove that the truth or falsity of the relation cannot be decided by adhering to the rules of arithmetic.”    “And so it has no mathematical proof.”    “Exactly. But this is precisely what the relation asserts: This statement is unprovable.”     “So it is true?”    “Yes, it is true. We can recognize it's true, not through mathematical rules, but from outside of mathematics. The truth of this statement does not follow from the inflexible chain of logical relations, the links that cleave one mathematical fact to another. It comes from a glance” - Jana Levin -Godel didn’t believe that truth would elude us. He proved that it would. He didn't invent a method to conform to this prejudice of the world-- at least not when I came to mathematics. He discovered his theorem as surely as if it was a rock he had dug up from the ground. Y ou can pass it around the table and it would be as real as a rock. If anyone cared too, they could dig it up where he buried it and find it just the same. Look for it and you'll find it where you said it is, just off center from where you're staring - Jana Levin -In cities and towns, religious practices often turned toward the new factory model as the Way to organize religious ethos. They venerated the factory assembly line more than the natural landscape. Many Protestant groups found the industrial ideal empowering. Progressive social reform became progressive Protestant religion: cleaner, whiter, brighter religious practices. The ministries of Dwight Moody and Josiah Strong are excellent examples of institutionalizing and mechanizing the conversion process. The teachings at theMoody Bible Institute in Chicago held that the process of “patience, prayer, Bible reading, and churchgoing\" opened people’s hearts and converted their souls. Dwight Moody preached that being born again was a thorough cleaning from the inside out. Congregationalist Josiah Strong protested the economic Woes of capitalism but echoed its machinery by preaching that process, standardization, and uniformity were the hallmarks of a “true Christian people.\" Both men discouraged the made—at—home Variety of religious practice. To be Christians, Americans were encouraged to submit to growing church institutions. Like a big healthy factory, mainstream Protestant churches tookpride in their size and efﬁciency. - Sue Marasco -If yoga was invented in Connecticut we’d call it stretching - Colin Cowherd -You spot it you got it - Colin Cowherd -You can eat an elephant one bite at a time - Anonymous -Don't try to get happier than happy. Appreciate the little things. Happy is pretty good - Colin Cowherd -The matter is quite simple. The bible is very easy to understand. But we Christians are a bunch of scheming swindlers. We pretend to be unable to understand it because we know very well that the minute we understand, we are obliged to act accordingly. Take any words in the New Testament and forget everything except pledging yourself to act accordingly. My God, you will say, if I do that my whole life will be ruined. How would I ever get on in the world? Herein lies the real place of Christian scholarship. Christian scholarship is the Church’s prodigious invention to defend itself against the Bible, to ensure that we can continue to be good Christians without the Bible coming too close. Oh, priceless scholarship, what would we do without you? Dreadful it is to fall into the hands of the living God. Yes it is even dreadful to be alone with the New Testament - Søren Kierkegaard -If the problem of evil is a problem for those who believe in God there must be a corresponding good that’s a problem for those who reject God - Peter Kreeft -In the wizard’s face he saw at first only lines of care and sorrow; though as he looked more intently he perceived that under all there was a great joy: a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laughing, were it to gush forth - JRR Tolkien -If you were to ask me to give definition of a Christian I should say that he is one who, since believer in Christ, feels himself to be the happiest man in the world and longs for everyone else to be equally happy - Martin Lloyd Jones -Student: I don’t know why I need to learn all this stuff first.

Patience requires not acting - Christopher Lupo -Bangable flesh trophy - Screen Junkies Narrator -There are bodies called church that are hardly Christian and merely grounds to worship patriotic sentiment with some Bible thrown in. The American Eagle and her flag is the real treasure, not Christ. Living faithfully under the Americana is both evil and good. There is much ground to speak, the constant swirl of conflict and the rights enumerated allow the Good News of the Kingdom to be preached. However, at the same time, there is the temptation to be co-opted by the State - Cal -It might be hard to hear, but there are churches among us that worship the Beast, promote its icon, and listen to a lamb with the voice of a dragon. Constantine is a mere figurehead and nominal placeholder. In America, a whole lot of churches are mere congregations of bestial worship. We need to soak in this hard truth for awhile. I am not promoting manufacturing crucifixes or even crosses, but does it bother no one to find an American flag in the heart of many assemblies? Is it not disturbing? This is patriolatry, worship of the nation and blood. As William Stringfellow once prophetically said, the Spirit of Nazi Germany won World War 2, and was willingly received by the US and USSR … many churches worship the Beast and go about lapping up blood through its many empire projects. Instead of spilling their own blood, they drink blood. They are not even bold enough to shed it themselves. They lie in their luxury, legs open, like the Whore of Babylon, and wait for their cup to be brought to them. Our modern clerical cabal is no different than the craven and craving coven of Cardinals that covered the continent - Cal -And as He spoke, He no longer looked to them like a lion; but the things that began to happen after that were so great and beautiful that I cannot write them. And for us this the end of all the stories, and we can most truly say that they all lived happily ever after. But for them it was only the beginning of the real story. All their life in this world and all their adventures in Narnia had only been the cover and the title page: now at last they were beginning Chapter One of the Great Story which no one on earth has read: which goes on for ever: in which every chapter is better than the one before - CS Lewis -\"Is it not Aslan's country?\" said Tirian.\"If you ask me,\" said Edmund, \"it's like somewhere in the Narnian world. Look at those mountains ahead - and the big ice-mountains beyond them. Surely they're rather like the mountains we used to see from Narnia, the ones up Westward beyond the Waterfall?\"\"I don't think those ones are so very like anything in Narnia,\" said Lucy. \"But look there.\" She pointed Southward to their left, and everyone stopped and turned to look. \"Those hills,\" said Lucy, \"the nice woody ones and the blue ones behind - aren't they very like the Southern border of Narnia?\"\"Like!\" cried Edmund after a moment's silence. \"Why, they're exactly like. Look, there's Mount Pire with his forked head, and there's the pass into Archenland and everything!\"\"And yet they're not like,\" said Lucy. \"They're different. They have more colours on them and they look further away than I remembered and they're more .. . more... oh, I don't know...\"\"More like the real thing,\" said the Lord Digory softly.Suddenly Farsight the Eagle spread his wings, soared thirty or forty feet up into the air, circled round and then alighted on the ground.\"Kings and Queens,\" he cried, \"we have all been blind. We are only beginning to see where we are. From up there I have seen it all - Ettinsmuir, Beaversdam, the Great River, and Cair Paravel still shining on the edge of the Eastern Sea. Narnia is not dead. This is Narnia.\"\"But how can it be?\" said Peter. \"For Aslan told us older ones that we should never return to Narnia, and here we are.\"\"Yes,\" said Eustace. \"And we saw it all destroyed and the sun put out.\"\"And it's all so different,\" said Lucy.\"The Eagle is right,\" said the Lord Digory. \"Listen, Peter. When Aslan said you could never go back to Narnia, he meant the Narnia you were thinking of. But that was not the real Narnia. That had a beginning and an end. It was only a shadow or a copy of the real Narnia which has always been here and always will be here: just as our world, England and all, is only a shadow or copy of something in Aslan's real world. You need not mourn over Narnia, Lucy. All of the old Narnia that mattered, all the dear creatures, have been drawn into the real Narnia through the Door. And of course it is different; as different as a real thing is from a shadow or as waking life is from a dream.\" His voice stirred everyone like a trumpet as he spoke these words: but when he added under his breath \"It's all in Plato, all in Plato: bless me, what do they teach them at these schools!\" CS Lewis -The destiny of the unevangelized is a common concern among Christians today. The following dialogue between to short-term missionaries in India captures the essence of typical discussion of the topic. The missionaries have just left a village where an elderly man earnestly asked them about all his ancestors who had never heard of Christ        \"Carl, I can't get the picture of that man's face out of my mind. The deep sadness in his eyes. It haunts me. I'm still deeply committed to world evangelization, but I am really questioning whether our witness is injured when we have no answer to suchan important question.\"        \"Look, Dale, we're not theologians. How can we be ex-pected to know what to say about such a difficult issue?\"        \"It just seemed so simple when we were back in the states during our training period. That was only three weeks ago, and I remember when Bill asked Prof. Lindum about the fate of those who had never heard about Jesus. The professor replied that if we were asked that question we were to just say that God has no other plan to save each person except they give their hearts to Jesus. He then quoted Acts 4:12, 'there is no other name under heaven given among men by which they must be saved.' That seemed satisfactory then, but when I have to look into the eyes of these people — real people and not statistics — I just can't bring myself to tell them that all their ances-tors are damned to hell.\"        \"I don't feel good about it either, but the truth is the truth. Jesus told us that he is the way, the truth, and the life. Nobody can get to heaven except through him. That man's ancestors didn't know about Jesus, so they can't be in heaven. That is all the more reason why we should get on with our evangelism so more people don't end up in hell.\"        'Do you really believe, Carl, that nine-tenths of the people who have ever lived on this planet are condemned to hell just because they never heard of Jesus? Do you want to say that maybe twenty billion will be in hell while only a few millionwill be in heaven?\"        \"The truth is not discovered by counting numbers, Dale. That is just a false American idea. Besides, they will be in hell because they rejected the revelation that God gave them, not because they never heard of Christ.\"        \"What would happen if somebody who hadn't heard of Christ did want to repent of sin and turn to God? Would God save them?\"        \"At one time I thought so, but Dr. Lindum told us that a person has to hear about the gospel of Jesus Christ in order to be saved. He also said that Scripture denies any other way, like a future chance after death. He referred to the verse thatsays 'after death comes judgment.'\"        \"But Carl, if people are damned for rejecting the light they have and can be saved only if they hear about Jesus, that would mean that the unevangelized only have an opportunity to be damned but not an opportunity to be saved. That justdoesn't sound fair to me.\"        \"Nobody said God had to be fair or that life is fair. It isn't fair, and that is why we who have experienced the grace of God in Jesus need to reach these people for Christ.\"        \"Well, if God isn't fair, then what about when Peter says `God is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance' and Paul's statement that God desires everyone to be saved? Does God really want everyone to besaved or not?\"        \"We have to distinguish between what God wants and what God gets. God does want everyone to be saved, but most Christians have not been willing to share their faith with others, so God's will has been thwarted because of our sinfulness. Those Christians who've been unwilling to evangelize will be judgedseverely for their neglect.\"        \"So what? They'll still be in heaven while most of the people who've ever lived will be in hell! Why should they get to go to heaven when they've been so disobedient?\"        \"Because nobody goes to heaven by obedience but only because of Jesus. Have you forgotten so basic a truth as grace?\"        \"Oh Carl, I know that's right. It's just that I'm so confused at the moment. I just don't see how God can condemn all of them for no fault of their own.        \"But it's their own fault that they are condemned, since they've rejected the light God has given them.\"        \"But if Jesus is the light of the world and God desires all people to see that light, it just seems to me that God would do something more than rely on a bunch of people like those in the church who have generally been unenthusiastic about evangelism. Why should the unevangelized not have an opportunity to be saved because of our neglect?\"        \"That's a good question. But if they could be saved apart from missionaries like us, then why bother to raise support like we did? Why should Christians spend so much money on missions? We know that Jesus commanded us to evangelize the world, so we know missions is the right thing to do.\" \"Do you think that all the infants who die go to hell too?\"\"Of course not! God would not condemn them, because they haven't done anything wrong. I believe all children who die before the age of accountability will be in heaven.\"        \"I'm glad to hear you say that, Carl. But how can you be so confident about the salvation of children and at the same time rule out all hope for the unevangelized? Why arc you so generous toward one group and not the other?\"        \"For two reasons. First, adults have all sinned against God. Second, Jesus said to 'permit the little children to come to me.' Heaven must be filled with children.\"        \"Well if you can push Jesus' statement that hard to say heaven is filled with children, then I don't see why you try to restrict what Paul and Peter said about God desiring to save all people. If God is willing to save all children who die, then it seems he'd do something about providing an opportunity for salvation to the vast majority of human beings who have ever lived. Look, we're almost to the next village. Let's talk about this more tonight. We'd better pray before we reach the village.\" - John Sanders -Emeth had been raised in a different country and followed a different religion -.

Every society in the history of man has had an integration point and people are not allowed to blaspheme against that central integration point … In Mecca you can’t blaspheme Allah. in medieval christendom you could get arrested for blaspheming Jesus. Today, I could go downtown in any major American city and get arrested on nothing more than on the basis of what I was saying. I could begin talking about certain sacred cows in our political life and I could get myself arrested. They arrest me for blasphemy they would arrest me for hate speech. Theocracies are inescapable. We’re a democracy … the people are the god of the system and there are certain protected classes of people whom I must not touch, I may not say anything about them, and if I say something about them they’re going to haul me in for reorientation, put me through sensitivity training. They’ll want to teach me the error of my ways and the fundamental thing they want me to admit is their right to be treating me this way and I must become my own accuser and I must say that I’m sorry - Douglas Wilson -American Exceptionalism, a sort of quasi-religious belief that the United States of America is a tool of, or specially destined by, a Judeo-Christian God, to perform His goals on Earth - orthogonality -The mind entertains the idea of sin, the imagination beautifies and converts it into a fascinating ideal, desire reaches out to it, and the will goes ahead and does it. Thus, in the case of both angels and humans, imagination was the faculty that made the violation of the commandment appear as the road to equality with God - Paul Maxwell -Person: Why do you make art that’s sad?Artificial intelligence: They’re not sad, they’re of time and distance and the sadness is within you - Andrew Dobson from Digitonal -This is the sum of what we shall offer unto this acting of the law of sin, in a way of fighting and warring against our souls, which is so often mentioned in the Scripture; and due consideration of it is of no small advantage unto us, especially to bring us unto self-abasement, to teach us to walk humbly and mournfully before God. There are two things that are suited to humble the souls of men, and they are, first, a due consideration of God, and then of themselves-of God, his is greatness, glory, holiness, power, majesty, and authority; of ourselves, in our mean, abject, and sinful condition. Now, of all the things in our condition, there is nothing so suited unto this end and purpose as that which lies before us; namely, the vile remainders of enmity against God which are yet in our hearts and natures. And it is no small evidence of a gracious soul when it is willing to search itself in this matter, and to be helped therein from a word of truth; when it is willing that the word should dive into the secret parts of the heart and rip open whatsoever of evil and corruption lies therein - John Owen -It lays hold on the mind suddenly with thoughtfulness about the present sin, possesses it, takes it up; so that either it recovers not itself at all to the considerations mentioned, or if any thoughts of them be suggested, the mind is so prepossessed and filled that they take no impression on the soul or make no abode in it...Sin and temptation do so possess and fill his [Davids] mind with the present object of his lust, that he utterly forgot, as it were, those considerations which he had formerly made use of when he so diligently kept himself from his iniquity. Here, therefore, lies the great wisdom of the soul, in rejecting the very first motions of sin, because by parleys with them the mind may be drawn off from attending unto its preservatives, and so the whole rush into evil - John Owen -And we find it by daily experience, that in prayer believers are led into such discoveries and convictions of the secret deceitful work of sin in their hearts, as no considerations could have led them into...The Spirit in this duty is as the candle of the Lord unto the soul, enabling it to search all the inward parts of the belly. It gives a holy, spiritual light into the mind, enabling it to search the deep and dark recesses of the heart, to find out the subtle and deceitful machinations, figments, and imaginations of the law of sin therein. Whatever notion there be of it, whatever power and prevalency in it, it is laid hand on, apprehended, brought into the presence of God, judged, condemned, bewailed. And what can possibly be more effectual for its ruin and destruction? For, together with its discovery, application is made unto all that relief which in Jesus Christ is provided against it, all ways and means whereby it may be ruined. Hence, it is the duty of the mind to “Watch unto prayer” -Deceit properly affects the mind; it is the mind that is deceived. When sin attempts any other way of entrance into the soul, as by the affections, the mind, retaining its right and sovereignty, is able to give check and control to it. But where the mind is tainted, the prevalency must be great; for the mind or understanding is the leading faculty of the soul, and what it fixes, the will and affections rush after, being capable of no consideration but what that presents unto them. Hence it is, that though entanglement of the affections unto sin be oftentimes most troublesome, yet the deceit of the mind is always most dangerous, and that because of the place that is possesses in the soul as unto all its operations - John Owen -Enemies in war are restless, pressing, and importunate, so is the law of sin. Does it set upon the soul? Cast off its motions; it returns again. Rebuke them by the power of grace; they withdraw for a while, and return again. Set before them the cross of Christ; they do as those that came to take him--at sight of him they went backwards and fell unto the ground, but they arose again and laid hands on him--sin gives place for a season, but returns and presses on the soul again. Mind it of the love God in Christ; though it be stricken, yet it gives not over. Present hell-fire unto it; it rushes into the midst of those flames. Reproach it with its folly and madness; it knows no shame, but presses still. Let the thoughts of the mind strive to fly from it; it follows as on the wings of the wind. And by this importunity it wearies and wears out the soul; and if the great remedy -Carry about a constant, humbling sense of this close aversation unto spiritualness that lies in our nature. If men find the efficacy of it, what should, what consideration can, be more powerful to bring them unto humble walking with God? That after all the discoveries that God has made of himself unto them, all the kindness they have received from him, his doing of them good and not evil things, there should yet be such a heart of unkindness and unbelief still abiding as to have an aversation lying in it to communion with him--how ought the thoughts of it cast us into the dust! To fill us with shame and self-abhorrency all our days! What have we found in God, in any of our approaches or address unto him, that it should be this with us? What iniquity have we found in him? Has he been a wilderness unto us, or a land of darkness? Did we ever lose anything by drawing nigh unto him? Nay, has not therein lain all the rest and peace which we have obtained? Is no the fountain and spring of all our mercies, of all our desirable things? Has he not bid us welcome at our coming? Have we not received from him more than heart can conceive or tongue express? - John Owen -The ‘heart’ in the Scripture is variously used; sometimes for the mind and understanding, sometimes for the will, sometimes for the affections, sometimes for the conscience, sometimes for the whole soul. Generally, it denotes the whole soul of man and all the faculties of it, not absolutely, but as they are all one principle of moral operations, as they all concur in our doing good or evil. The mind, as it inquires, discerns, and judges what is to be done, what refused; the will, as it chooses or refuses or avoids; the affections, as they like or dislike, cleave to or have an aversation from, that which is proposed to them; the conscience, as it warns and determines--are all together called the heart - John Owen -It is [law of indwelling sin] not an outward, written, commanding, directing law, but an inbred, working, impelling, urging law. A law proposed unto us is not to be compared, for efficacy, to a law inbred in us. Let us take an example from that law which is contrary to this law of sin. The law of God was at first inbred and natural unto man; it was consecrated with his faculties, and was their rectitude, both in being and in operation, in reference to this end of living unto God and glorifying him. Hence it had a special power in the whole soul to enable it unto all obedience, yea, and to make all obedience easy and pleasant. Such is the power of an inbred law … Afterward God renews this law and writes it in tables of stone. But what is the efficacy of this law? Will it now, as it is external and proposed unto men, enable them to perform the things that it exacts and requires? Not at all. God knew it would not, unless it were turned into an internal law again; that is, until of a moral outward rule, it be turned into an inward real principle. Wherefore God makes this law internal again, and implants it on the hearts as it was at first, when he intends to give it power to produce obedience to his people: ‘I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts’” -The people who are in danger of judgement are not being judged on the basis of how many good deeds they’ve done and how many obedient actions they have. They’re being judged on the basis of their heart … Now some people say ‘wait a minute how does this fit? aren’t there an awful lot of places that say we’ll be judged according to our works? Doesn’t Paul say in Romans 2 6 on the last day we’ll be judged on the basis of what we have done? Doesn’t it even say in John 5 27-30 Jesus actually says that on the last day he says ‘I will judge them and on the last day people will rise and those who have done good to life and those who have done evil to destruction’’ So how do we square what the Bible says in Romans three where it says ‘no one can be good enough to earn salvation and reward’ with these statements that judgement is on the basis of works? The answer is Jesus has a metaphor that pulls it all together. It’s a very important metaphor in understanding judgement day. He says in Matthew seven ‘by their fruit you will know them.’ Now that’s perfect. He’s thinking of a tree … How do we know a tree is a live? How do we judge between them? … by their fruit! But does their fruit cause the life? No, of course not. The fruit is an index of a life … The reason God looks at the works is to find out what’s in the heart. If your heart is self-centered, self-referential, self-saving, self-righteous; versus, open to God, humble, needing his grace and mercy there’s going to be a difference in the way you live, but the key thing is the heart - Timothy Keller -We must have a judgement day we can’t bear a judgement day, but in Jesus Christ we’ve already had a judgement day. That’s the gospel - Timothy Keller -We have arrived, then, to the sum of this safeguarding duty, of this condition of freedom from the power of temptation: He that, having a due, acquaintance with the gospel in its excellencies, as to him a word of mercy, holiness, liberty, consolation, values it, in all its concerns, as his choicest and only treasure--makes it his business and the work of his life to give himself up unto it in universal obedience, then especially when opposition and apostasy put the patience of Christ at the utmost--he shall be preserved from the hour of temptation - John Owen -He was the Meekest and lowliest of all the sons of men, yet he spoke of coming on the clouds of heaven with the glory of God. He was so austere that evil spirits and demons cried out in terror at his coming, yet he was so genial and winsome and approachable that the children loved to play with him, and the little ones nestled in his arms. His presence at the innocent gaiety of a village wedding was like the presence of sunshine.No one was half so compassionate to sinners, yet no one ever spoke such red-hot, scorching words about sin. A bruised reed he would not break. His whole like was love, yet on one occassion he demanded of the Pharisees how they ever expected to escape the damnation of hell. He was a dreamer of dreams and a seer of visions, yet for sheer start realism he has all of our self-styled realists soundly beaten. He was a servant of all, washing the disciples’ feet, yet masterfully he strode into the temple, and the hucksters and the moneychangers fell over one another from the mad rush and the fire they saw blazing in his eyes.He saved others, yet at the last, himself he did not save. There is nothing in history like the union of contrasts that confronts us in the gospels. The mystery of Jesus is the mystery of divine personality - James Stewart -The only reason coders' computers work better than non-coders' computers is coders know computers are schizophrenic little children with autoimmune diseases and we don't beat them when they're bad - Peter Welch -Sometimes to make the hard things simple, we have to make the simple things harder - Vi Art -I am a poor, weak creature; unstable as water, I cannot excel. This corruption is too hard for me, and is at the very door of ruining my soul; and what to do I know not. My soul is become as parched ground, and an habitation of dragons. I have made promises and broken them, vows and engagements have been as a thing naught. Many persuasions have I had that I got the victory and should be delivered, but I am deceived; so that I plainly see, that without some eminent succor and assistance, I am lost, and shall be prevailed on to an utter relinquishment of God. But yet, though this be my state and condition, let the hands that hang down be lifted up, and the feeble knees be strengthened. Behold, the Lord Christ, that has fullness of grace in his heart, all fullness of power in his hand, he is able to slay all these his enemies. There is sufficient provision in him for my relief and assistance. He can take my drooping, dying soul and make me more than a conqueror -  John Owen -What have I done? What love, what mercy, what blood, what grace have I despised and trampled on! Is this the return I make to the Father for his love, to the son for his blood, to the Holy Ghost for his grace? Do I thus repay the Lord? Have I defiled the heart that Christ died to wash, that the blessed Spirit has chosen to dwell in? And can I keep myself out of the dust? What can I say to the dear Lord Jesus? How shall I hold up my head with any boldness before him? Do I account communion with him of so little value, that for this vile lust’s sake I have scarce left him any room in my heart? How shall I escape if I neglect so great salvation? In the meantime, what shall I say to the Lord? Love, mercy, grace, goodness, peace, joy, consolation--I have despised them all, and esteemed them as a thing of naught, that I might harbor a lust in my heart. Have I obtained a view of God’s fatherly countenance, that I might behold his face and provoke him to his face? Was my soul washed, that room might be made for new defilements? Shall I endeavor to dissapoint the end of the death of Christ? Shall I daily grieve that Spirit whereby I am sealed to the day of redemption - John Owen -The difference between believers and unbelievers as to knowledge is not so much in the matter of their knowledge as in the manner of knowing. Unbelievers, some of them, may know more and be able to say more of God, his perfections, and his will, than many believers; but they know nothing as they ought, nothing in right manner, nothing spiritually saving, nothing with holy heavenly light. The excellency of a believer is, not that he has a large apprehension of things, but that what he does apprehend, which perhaps may be very little, he sees it in the light of the Spirit of God, in a saving, soul-transforming light; and this is that which gives us the communion with God, and not prying thoughts or curious-raised questions - John Owen -Youth is not entirely a time of life – it is a state of mind.  It is not wholly a matter of ripe cheeks, red lips or supply knees.  It is a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions, a freshness of the deep springs of life.  It means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, of an appetite for adventure over love of ease.Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years.  People grow old only by deserting their ideals.  Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up interest wrinkles the soul.Worry, doubt, self-distrust, fear and despair – these are the long, long years that bow the head and turn the growing spirit back to dust.  Whatever your years, there is in every being’s heart the love of wonder, the undaunted challenge of events, the unfailing child-like appetite for what next, and the joy in the game of life.You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; as young as your self-confidence, as old as your fear; as young as your hope, as old as your despair.In the central place of every heart there is a recording chamber; so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer and courage, so long are you young.  When the wires are all down and your heart is covered with the moss of pessimism and the ice of cynicism, then, and then only, are you grown old. - General MacArthur -All that is not eternal is eternally out of date - CS Lewis -Virtue is like precious odors. most fragrant when incensed or crushed; for prosperity best finds vice, but adversity best find discovers virtue - Francis Bacon -I have naturally formed the habit of restraining my thoughts. A thoughtless word hardly ever escaped my tongue or pen. Experience has taught me that silence is part of the spiritual discipline of a votary of truth. We find so many people impatient to talk. All this talking can hardly be said to be of any benefit to the world. It is so much waste of time. My shyness has been in reality my shield and buckler. It has allowed me to grow. It has helped me in my discernment of truth - Ghandi -Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that - George Carlin -All men seek happiness. This is without exception. Whatever different means they employ, they all tend to this end. The cause of some going to war, and of others avoiding it, is the same desire in both, attended with different views. The will never takes the least step but to this object. This is the motive of every action of every man, even of those who hang themselves - Blaise Pascal -You’re becoming who you admire - Elliott Hulse -Some day you will read in the papers that D.L. Moody of East Northfield, is dead. Don't you believe a word of it! At that moment I shall be more alive than I am now; I shall have gone up higher, that is all, out of this old clay tenement into a house that is immortal- a body that death cannot touch, that sin cannot taint; a body fashioned like unto His glorious body.I was born of the flesh in 1837. I was born of the Spirit in 1856. That which is born of the flesh may die. That which is born of the Spirit will live forever - Dwight L Moody -To worship is to quicken the conscience by the holiness of God, to feed the mind with the truth of God, to purge the imagination by the beauty of God, to open the heart to the love of God, to devote the will to the purpose of God - William Temple -There is, in the life of the fourteenth-century German mystic Johann Tauler, a remarkable story that shows something of the attitude Jesus was looking for in his disciples.One day Tauler met a beggar. 'God give you a good day, my friend', he said.The beggar answered. 'I thank God I never had a bad one'.Then Tauler said, 'God give you a happy life, my friend'.'I thank God', said the beggar, 'that I am never unhappy'.In amazement Tauler asked, 'What do you mean?''Well',said the beggar, 'when it is fine I thank God. When it rains I thank God. And, since God's will is my will, and whatever pleases him pleases me, why should I say I am unhappy when I am not?'Tauler looked at the man in astonishment'. 'What are you?' he asked.'I am a king', said the beggar.'Where, then, is your kingdom?'asked Tauler.The beggar replied quietly , 'In my heart'. - Michael Green -For my heart’s desireUnto you is bent:                  I aspireTo a full consent - George Herbert -A species in which everyone was General Patton would not succeed, any more than would a race in which everyone was Vincent van Gogh. I prefer to think that the planet needs athletes, philosophers, sex symbols, painters, scientists; it needs the warmhearted, the hardhearted, the coldhearted, and the weakhearted. It needs those who can devote their lives to studying how many droplets of water are secreted by the salivary glands of dogs under which circumstances, and it needs those who can capture the passing impression of cherry blossoms in a fourteen-syllable poem or devote twenty-five pages to the dissection of a small boy’s feelings as he lies in bed in the dark waiting for his mother to kiss him goodnight. -  Allen Shawn -Where men are forbidden to honour a king they honour millionaires, athletes, or film-stars instead: even famous prostitutes or gangsters. For spiritual nature, like bodily nature, will be served; deny it food and it will gobble poison. - CS Lewis -If Christ is not all to you He is nothing to you. He will never go into partnership as a part Saviour of men. If He be something He must be everything, and if He be not everything He is nothing to you - Charles Spurgeon -But the new rebel is a skeptic, and will not entirely trust anything. He has no loyalty; therefore he can never be really a revolutionist. And the fact that he doubts everything really gets in his way when he wants to denounce anything. For all denunciation implies a moral doctrine of some kind; and the modern revolutionist doubts not only the institution he denounces, but the doctrine by which he denounces it. . . . As a politician, he will cry out that war is a waste of life, and then, as a philosopher, that all life is waste of time. A Russian pessimist will denounce a policeman for killing a peasant, and then prove by the highest philosophical principles that the peasant ought to have killed himself. . . . The man of this school goes first to a political meeting, where he complains that savages are treated as if they were beasts; then he takes his hat and umbrella and goes on to a scientific meeting, where he proves that they practically are beasts. In short, the modern revolutionist, being an infinite skeptic, is always engaged in undermining his own mines. In his book on politics he attacks men for trampling on morality; in his book on ethics he attacks morality for trampling on men. Therefore the modern man in revolt has become practically useless for all purposes of revolt. By rebelling against everything he has lost his right to rebel against anything - G.K. Chesterton -Joy is love exulting, and peace is love at rest.Patience, love enduring in every trial and test.Gentleness, love yielding to all that is not sin.Goodness, love in actions that flow from Christ within;Faith is love's eyes opened the living Christ to see,Meekness, love not fighting but bowed at Calvary.Temperance, love in harness and under Christ's control,For Christ is love in person, and Christ in the soul - Kenneth Moynaugh -Everyone believes himself a priori to be perfectly free, even in his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life. ... But a posteriori, through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns, and as it were, play the part which he has undertaken, to the very end - Arthur Schopenhauer -Every chief of a sect of philosophy has been a little of a quack … The further I go, the more I am confirmed in the idea that systems of metaphysics are for philosophers what novels are for women … It is only charlatans who are certain. We know nothing of first principles. It is truly extravagant to define God, angels, and minds, and to know precisely why God formed the world, when we do not know why we move our arms at will. Doubt is not a very agreeable state, but certainty is a ridiculous one. I do not know how I was made, and how I was born. I did not know at all, during a quarter of my life, the causes of what I saw, or heard, or felt … I have seen that which is called matter, both as the star of Sirius, and as the smallest atom which can be perceived with the microscope, and I do not know what this matter is - Voltaire -To spend too much time in studies is sloth; to use them too much for ornament is affection; to make judgement wholly on their rules is the humour of a scholar … Crafty men condemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them; for they teach not their own use; but that is a wisdom without them, and above them, won by observation - Francis Bacon -Of all relations the most universal is that of contrast or opposition, every condition of thought or of things--every idea and every situation in the world--leads irresistibly to its opposite, and then unites it with it to form a higher or more complex whole” “thesis, antithesis and synthesis constitute the formula and secret of all development and all reality- Hegel and Fichte -The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already - George Orwell -When Moses writes that God created heaven and earth and whatever is in them in six days, then let this period continue to have been six days, and do not venture to devise any comment according to which six days were one day. But, if you cannot understand how this could have been done in six days, then grant the Holy Spirit the honor of being more learned than you are. - Martian Luther -I can offer you no consolation. Your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?  - Clerval from Frankeinstein -We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil - Donald Kuth -The internet is a magical place where things can be taken out of context in a matter of seconds before blowing up on an epic scale of stupidity and lazyness - irkitated.com -You think you know, but you really don't know - Jim Mora and Colin Cowherd -Sturgeons law: ninety percent of everything is crap - Theodore Sturgeon -But even democracy ruins itself by excess-of democracy.  Its basic principle is the equal right of all to hold office and determine public policy.  This is at first glance a delightful arrangement; it becomes disastrous because the people are not properly equipped by education to select the best rulers and the wisest courses.As to the people, they have no understanding, and only repeat what their rulers are pleased to tell them.  To get a doctrine accepted or rejected it is only necessary to have it praised or ridiculed in a popular play.Mob-rule is a rough sea for the  ship of state to ride; every wind of oratory stirs up the waters and deflects the course.The upshot of such a democracy is tyranny or autocracy; the crowd so loves flattery…that at last the wiliest and most unscrupulous flatterer, calling himself the ‘protector of the people’ rises to supreme power. - Will Durant -One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing - Socrates -You deserve the life you tolerate - Kimberly Ann Vadala -To understand the workings of American politics, you have to understand this fundamental law: Conservatives think liberals are stupid. Liberals think conservatives are evil - Charles Krauthammer -Error, indeed, is never set forth in its naked deformity, lest, being thus exposed, it should at once be detected. But it is craftily decked out in an attractive dress, so as, by its outward form, to make it appear to the inexperienced -Tell me the judgement day truth - John Shield of peoples memorial christian church  -Hurting people hurt people - John Shield of peoples memorial christian church -Every time you face a tough decision you should have no less than forty percent and no more than seventy percent of the information you need to make the decision. If you  make a decision with less than forty percent of the information you need you are shooting from the hip and you will make too many mistakes. The second part of the decision making rule is what surprises many leaders. They often think that they need more than seventy percent of the information before they can make a decision. But, I explain to them, if you get more than seventy percent of the information you need to make the decision then the opportunity has usually passed and someone else has beaten you to the punch. A key element that supports Powell’s rule is the notion that intuition is what separates the great leaders from the average ones. Intuition is what allows us to make tough decisions well, but many of us ignore our gut. We want certainty that we are making the right decision, but that is not possible. In my experience, people who want certainty in their decisions end up working for other people, not leading - Colin Powell -It’s better to be slow right than fast wrong - John Shield of peoples memorial christian church -Coaching is all about getting the best from the best and the most from the least. That’s all it is - Trent Dilfer -No man knows how bad he is till he has tried very hard to be good. A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means. This is an obvious lie. Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is. After all, you find out the strength of the German army by fighting against it, not by giving in. You find out the strength of a wind by trying to walk against it, not by lying down. A man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later. That is why bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness — they have lived a sheltered life by always giving in. We never find out the strength of the evil impulse inside us until we try to fight it: and Christ, because He was the only man who never yielded to temptation, is also the only man who knows to the full what temptation means — the only complete realist. - CS Lewis -The utopian schemes of leveling and a community of goods, are as visionary and impractical as those which vest all property in the crown. These ideas are arbitrary, despotic, and, in our government unconstitutional. – Samuel Adams -If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be. – Thomas Jefferson -True law is right reason in agreement with nature; it is of universal application, unchanging and everlasting; it summons to duty by its commands, and averts from wrong-doing by its prohibitions. And it does not lay its commands or prohibitions upon good men in vain, though neither have any effect on the wicked. It is a sin to try to to [sic] alter this law, nor is it allowable to attempt to repeal any part of it, and it is impossible to abolish it entirely. We cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people, and we need not look outside ourselves for an expounder or interpreter of it. And there will not be different laws at Rome and at Athens, or different laws now and in the future, but one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and all times, and there will be one master and ruler, that is, God, over us all, for he is the author of this law, its promulgator, and its enforcing judge. Whoever is disobedient is fleeing from himself and denying his human nature, and by reason of this very fact he will suffer the worst penalties, even if he escapes what is commonly considered punishment. – Cicero -The animal which we call man, endowed with foresight and quick intelligence, complex, keen, possessing memory, full of reason and prudence, has been given a certain distinguished status by the Supreme God who created him; for he is the only one among so many different kinds and varieties of living beings who has a share in reason and thought while all the rest are deprived of it. But what is more divine, I will not say in man only, but in all heaven and earth, than reason? And reason, when it is full grown and perfected, is rightly called wisdom. Therefore, since there is nothing better than reason, and since it exists both in man and God, the first common possession of man and God is reason. But those who have reason in common must also have right reason in common. And since right reason is Law, we must believe that men have Law also in common with the gods. Further, those who share Law must also share Justice; and those who share these are to be regarded as members of the same commonwealth. If indeed they obey the same authorities and powers, this is true in a far greater degree; but as a matter of fact they do obey this celestial system, the divine mind, and of the God of transcendent power. Hence we must now conceive of this whole universe as one commonwealth of which both gods and men are members. – Cicero -Is there no virtue among us? If there be not, we are in a wretched situation. No theoretical checks-no form of government can render us secure. To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea, if there be sufficient virtue and intelligence in the community, it will be exercised in the selection of these men. So that we do not depend on their virtue, or put confidence in our rulers, but in the people who are to choose them. – James Madison -Here is my creed: I believe in one God, the Creator of the universe. That he governs it by his providence. That he ought to be worshipped. That the most acceptable service we render to him is in doing good to his other children. That the soul of man is immortal, and will be treated with justice in another life respecting its conduct in this. These I take to be the fundamental points in all sound religion. – Benjamin Franklin -America is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great. – de Toqueville -To begin with, each person, knows that he exists. With Descartes each person can say, Cogito ergo sum.” With God, each person can say, ‘I AM!’ Furthermore, each person knows that he is something. He also knows that a something could not be produced by a nothing. It follows that this something which did all of this organizing and arranging would have to be all-knowing to the full extent required for such an organization and arrangement. This something would therefore have to be superior to everything which had resulted from this effort. This element of superiority makes this something the ultimate “good” for all that has been organized and arranged. In the Anglo-Saxon language, the word for supreme or ultimate good is ‘God.’  – Skousen -Man is capable of knowing many things about God, Locke said. The Creator must of necessity be a cogitative -He then went on to say that the will of God which is expressed in the orderly arrangement of the universe is called \"the law of nature,\" and that there are laws for \"human\" nature just as surely as they exist for the rest of the universe. He said the laws for human nature had been revealed by God, whereas the laws of the universe -The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions: for men being all the workmanship of one omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker; all the servants of one sovereign master, sent into the world by his order, and about his business; they are his property, whose workmanship they are, made to last during his, not one another's pleasure: and being furnished with like faculties, sharing all in one community of nature, there cannot be supposed any such subordination among us, that may authorize us to destroy one another… – John Locke -And these may be reduced to three principal or primary articles; the right of personal security, the right of personal liberty; and the right of private property: because as there is no other known method of compulsion, or of abridging man's natural free will, but by an infringement or diminution of one or other of these important rights, the preservation of these, inviolate, may justly be said to include the preservation of our civil immunities in their largest and most extensive sense. – Sir William Blackstone -We hold from God the gift which includes all others. This gift is life -- physical, intellectual, and moral life. But life cannot maintain itself alone. The Creator of life has entrusted us with the responsibility of preserving, developing, and perfecting it. In order that we may accomplish this, He has provided us with a collection of marvelous faculties. And He has put us in the midst of a variety of natural resources. By the application of our faculties to these natural resources we convert them into products, and use them. This process is necessary in order that life may run its appointed course. Life, faculties, production--in other words, individuality, liberty, property -- this is man. And in spite of the cunning of artful political leaders, these three gifts from God precede all human legislation, and are superior to it. Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place. – Frederic Bastiat -But as He is also a Being of infinite wisdom, He has laid down only such laws as were founded in those relations of justice, that existed in the nature of things antecedent to any positive precept. These are the eternal, immutable laws of good and evil, to which the Creator Himself in all his dispensations conforms; and which He has enabled human reason to discover, so far as they are necessary for the conduct of human actions. Such, among others, are these principles: that we should live honestly, should hurt nobody, and should render to everyone his due… – Sir William Blackstone -The reason why men enter into society is the preservation of their property… – John Locke -Though the earth, and all inferior creatures, be common to all men, yet every man has a property in his own person: this no body has any right to but himself. The labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property.”… “He that is nourished by the acorns he picked up under an oak, or the apples he gathered from the trees in the wood, has certainly appropriated them to himself. No body can deny but the nourishment is his. I ask then, when did they begin to be his? when he digested? or when he eat? or when he boiled? or when he brought them home? or when he picked them up? and it is plain, if the first gathering made them not his, nothing else could. – John Locke - There are only two kinds of people in the end, those who say to God, ‘Thy will be done,’ and those to whom God says, in the end, ’Thy will be done.’ – C.S. Lewis -It is funny how mortals always picture us as putting things into their minds: in reality our best work is done by keeping things out. – Screwtape -Keep them watching their own minds and trying to produce feelings… let them be trying to feel forgiven… let them suspect how much success or failure of that kind depends on whether they are well or ill, fresh or tired, at that moment. – Screwtape -It is your business to see that the patient never thinks of the present fear as his appointed cross, but only of the things he is afraid of… and let him try to practise fortitude and patience to them all in advance… the Enemy does not greatly assist those who are trying to attain it… – Screwtape -Never forget that when we are dealing with any pleasure in its healthy and normal satisfying from, we are, in a sense, on the Enemy’s ground… all our research so far has not enabled us to produce one [pleasure]… hence we always try to work away from the natural condition of any pleasures to that in which it is least natural… an ever increasing craving for an ever diminishing pleasure is the formula. – Screwtape -All mortals tend to turn into the thing they are pretending to be. – Screwtape -But flippancy is the best of all… every serious subject is discussed in a manner which implies that they have already found a ridiculous side to it. If prolonged, the habit of Flippancy build up around a man the finest armour plating against the Enemy that I know… it deadens, instead of sharpening, the intellect… – Screwtape -First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Socialist.Then they came for the Trade Unions, and I did not speak out—Because I was not a Trade Unionist.Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—Because I was not a Jew.And then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me. – Niemöller -We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness…That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed… But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security… And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor. – Declaration of IndependenceWe the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. – Constitution of the United StatesQuestion with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blind-folded fear. – Thomas Jefferson -God is the only comfort, He is also the supreme terror: the thing we most need and the thing we most want to hide from. He is our only possible ally, and we have made ourselves His enemies. – C.S. Lewis -If you look for truth, you may find comfort in the end: if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth… – C.S. Lewis -A fact that is mixed in a very important way with our work is the thing that became commonly known during the last war as 'expendability.'\"The flying business is full of illustrations of this basic principle. God has seen fit to make a vehicle that is expendable essential to progress. There is always a price that must be paid.\"During the last war we were taught that, in order to obtain our objective, we had to be willing to be expendable, and many lives were spent paying the price of our redemption from bonds of political slavery.\"This very afternoon thousands of soldiers are known by their serial numbers as men who are expendable. During the last war we saw big bombers on the assembly line, row after row, powerful, costly implements of war! Yet all knew- we actually knew that many of those bombers would not accomplish even five missions over enemy territory. We also knew that young fellows, many of them volunteers, would ride in those airborne machine-gun turrets, and their life expectancy behind those guns was, with trigger down, only four minutes. Tremendous expendability!\"We know there is only one answer when our country demands that we share in the price of freedom- yet when the Lord Jesus asks us to pay the price for world evangelism, we often answer without a word. We cannot go. We say it costs too much.\"God Himself laid down the law when He built the universe. He knew when He made it what the price was going to be. And the Lamb of God was slain in the counsels of God before the foundation of the world. If God didn't hold back His only Son, but gave Him up to pay the price for our failure and sin, then how can we Christians hold back our lives- the lives He really owns?\"The Lord tells us that He that loveth His life- we might say that he that is selfish with his life- shall lose it. It's inescapable.\"Missionaries constantly face expendability. And people who do not know the Lord ask why in the world we waste our lives as missionaries. They forget that they too are expending their lives. They forget that when their lives are spent and the bubble has burst they will have nothing of eternal significance to show for the years they have wasted.\"Some might say, isn't it too great a price to pay? When missionaries consider themselves- their lives before God- they consider themselves expendable. And in our personal lives as Christians isn't the same thing true? Isn't the price small in light of God's infinite love? Those who know the joy of leading a stranger to Christ and those who have gone to tribes who have never heard the gospel, gladly count themselves expendable. And they count it all joy.\"'Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abidth alone,' the apostle Paul said. 'I die daily. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.'\"And Jesus said, 'There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time... and in the world to come eternal life.' – Nate Saint -Man, It's just some folks say, \"All truth is relative, it just depends on what you believe.\" You know, \"hey man, ain't no way to know for sure who God is or what's really true.\" But that means you believe your own statement; that there's no way to know what's really true. You're saying that that statement is true. You're killing yourself. If what's true for you is true for you and what's true for me is true for me, what if my truth says your's is a lie? Is it still true? Come on man! – Lecrae Moore -You look man, \"Some people say that God ain't real 'cause they don't see how a good God can exist with all this evil in the world. If God is real then He should stop all this evil, 'cause He's all-powerful right? What is evil though man? It's anything that's against God. It's anything morally bad or wrong. It's murder, rape, stealing, lying, cheating. But if we want God to stop evil, do we want Him to stop it all or just a little bit of it? If He stops us from doing evil things, what about lying, or what about our evil thoughts? I mean, where do you stop, the murder level, the lying level, or the thinking level? If we want Him to stop evil, we gotta be consistent, we can't just pick and choose. That means you and I would be eliminated right? Because we think evil stuff. If that's true, we should be eliminated! But thanks be to God that Jesus stepped in to save us from our sin! Christ died for all evilness! Repent, turn to Jesus man!  – Lecrae Moore -To me, toughness is doing the right thing when it's hard to do the right thing, – Ray Harper -All warfare is based on deception. – Sun Tzu -Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought.The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.  Thus do many calculationslead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! – Sun Tzu -There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare. – Sun Tzu -In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country wholeand intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.  So, too, it is better to recapture an army entirethan to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellenceconsists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy’s plans; the next best is to prevent        thejunction of the enemy’s forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy’s army in the field; and theworst policy of all is to besiege walled cities – Sun Tzu -If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of ahundred battles.  If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffera defeat.  If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. –Sun Tzu -29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak. – Sun Tzu -43. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory. – Sun Tzu -25. Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death. – Sun Tzu -17. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical. – Sun Tzu -Only he who believes is obedient, and only he who is obedient believes – Dietrich Bonhoeffer -When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die – Dietrich Bonhoeffer -An unfaltering devotion to honesty, truthfulness, doing one’s duty, and doing what is right – Core Value of the United States Air Force -nobility of soul, magnanimity, and a scorn of meanness. – Dr. Samuel Johnson -Who what when where why how – Christopher Lupo -The love for our enemies takes us along the way of the cross and into the fellowship of the Crucified. The more we are driven along this road, the more certain is the victory of love over the enemy’s hatred. – Dietrich Bonhoeffer -No, his real meaning is that to renounce rebellion and revolution is the most appropriate way of expressing our conviction that the Christian hope is not set on this world, but on Christ and his kingdom. And so—let the slave remain a slave! It is not reform that the world needs, for it is already ripe with destruction - Dietrich Bonhoeffer -Missions exist because worship doesn’t – John Piper -God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him – John Piper -My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next. – Maximus Decimus Meridius -Let’s face it: singleness is not an inherently inferior state of affairs. … But I want to be married. I pray to that end every day. I may meet someone and walk down the aisle in the next couple of years because God is so good to me. I may never have another date … because God is so good to me – Paige Brown -There is much confusion between land and country. Land is the place where corn, gullies, and mortgages grow. Country is the personality of land, the collective harmony of its soil, life, and weather. Country knows no mortgages, no alphabetical agencies, no tobacco road; it is calmly aloof to these petty exigencies of its alleged owners. That the previous occupant of my farm was a bootlegger mattered not one whit to its grouse; they sailed as proudly over the thickets as if they were guests of a king.\"Poor land may be rich country, and vice versa. Only economists mistake physical opulence for riches. Country may be rich despite a conspicuous poverty of physical endowment, and its quality may not be apparent at first glance, nor at all times. – Aldo Leopold -I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations — one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it — you will regret both. — Søren Kierkegaard -Marry, and you will regret it; don’t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don’t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret it either way; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it; believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way; believing a woman or not believing her, you will regret it both ways. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don’t hang yourself, you’ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy. — Søren Kierkegaard -Humility begins and finds its strength--in the knowledge that it is God who works all in all, that our place is to yield to Him in perfect resignation and dependence, in full consent to be and to do nothing of ourselves - Andrew Murray -Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it’s thinking of yourself less - C.S. Lewis -O Father, give us the humility which realizes its ignorance,Admits its mistakes, recognizes its need, welcomes advice,Accepts rebuke. Help us always to praise rather than to criticize,To sympathize rather than to discourage, to build rather than to destroy,And to think of people at their best rather than at their worst.This we ask for thy name's sake.Amen - William Barclay -Humility is simply acknowledging the truth of his position as creature and yielding to God his place - Andrew Murray -Humility is to make a proper estimate of one’s self. It is no humility for a man to think less of himself than he ought - C.H. Spurgeon -If you haven't learned you don't know that much then you haven't learned enough - Christopher Lupo -He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose - Jim Elliot -No citizen has a right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training...what a disgrace it is for a man to grow old without ever seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable - Socrates -Any great evil eventually gives rise to protest - Gifford Pinchot -The master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation, his love and his religion. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence at whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him he is always doing both - James Michener -I walked about the chamber most of the time. I imagined myself only to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions. It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no more. My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its peril - Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte -Aim small miss small - Benjamin Martin -The real workout starts when you want to stop - Misc -Children aren't coloring books. You don't get to fill them with your favorite colors. - Khaled Hosseini -there is only one sin, only one and that is theft. Every other sin is a variation of theft. When you kill a man, you steal a life... you steal his wife's right to a husband, rob his children of a father. When you tell a lie, you steal someone's right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness... there is no act more wretched than stealing - Khaled Hosseini -Allow yourself the uncomfortable luxury of changing your mind - Maria Popova -If a leader is going to give away a thousand dockets he should do it one docket at a time, because people forget. But, if he has to slay a thousand soldiers he should do it in one night, because people forget - Wilton Daniel Gregory -I get it, but I don’t get it - Propoganda -
